# Gaggia Classic Espresso Machine Upgrade.

These files make up a complete program to run on an arduino with a rotery encoder and a solid state relay!
The menu system enables you to change target temperatures and access cleaning programs, while the pid controlls the heater 
whether to heat coffee or produce steam!

## Coffee



#### The users goals of this system are:
* An easy to navigate menu
* Low power consumption
* Zero landfill
* Create great food fast


#### I think this system gives this to the user because:
* The rotery encoder is easy to use with one button click.
* The display cycles through current realtime data such as temperature and humidity.
* The entire system only takes 210 watts max.
* The system can user multiple types of hydroponic platforms such as, Deep Water Culture, Nutrient Film Technique, Ebb and Flow etc.
* Due to the use of pool noodles, jiffy's, netcups, clay pebbles and coco, there is no rockwool so zero landfill.

 
 ## Features:
* Rotery encoder for navigation
* Lcd display for easy and real time data
  
 
## Parts:
* 1x Arduino Uno (Rev3) [here](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3)
* 3x DS18B20 Water temp sensors [here](https://www.cricklewoodelectronics.com/Waterproof-Digital-Temperature-Probe-for-Arduino-DS18B20.html) Unfortunatly there are not the ones in use currently.
* 1x KY-040 Rotery Encoder [here](https://www.cricklewoodelectronics.com/Rotary-encoder-module-for-Arduino-KY-040.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIybWK-_Pl6QIVS7DtCh2XhAvKEAQYAyABEgKdBPD_BwE) 
* 1x Lcd 1602i2c Display [here](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Oniichan_is_ded/lcd-i2c-tutorial-664e5a)
* 1x 5v 30amp Relay [here](https://robotdyn.com/relay-module-1-relay-5v-30a.html)



### Setup program flow:
On pressing the rotary encoder centre button
